              Associated States to do so. Grenada is home to a population of
              around 112,207 individuals. Individuals of African descent account

                Jab Jab is core to the culture of Grenada. In fact, the Jab Jab
                is uniquely Grenadian, and is an aspect of our culture that
                distinguishes the Spice Island from other islands within the
                Caribbean region. Jab Jab is a celebration of freedom including
                freedom from hardships. In the post slavery era, Jab Jab has
                remained and today forms a core part of Grenadian culture and
                rich heritage. The word, “Jab Jab” is a noun, that is French
                Creole in origin, meaning diable or devil. The literal meaning
                is not related to demonic culture, but spirits of our African
                ancestors.

              The African and Carib-Amerindian heritage of the Islanders has
              influenced Grenada’s performing arts scene. Reggae, jazz, soca,
              Calypso, etc., are some of the country’s most popular genres of
              music. African dances introduced in the country have evolved over
              the years. European dances like quadrilles and picquets have also
              shaped the Grenadian dances. Today, some of the most popular
              dances on the islands are Carriacou Big Drum, Heel-and-Toe, and
              Quadrille.
