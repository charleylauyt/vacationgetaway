      <p>
        Indian cuisine dates back over 5000 years. Each region has its own
        traditions, religions and culture that influence its food. Indian
        cuisine is meant to be eaten socially, in groups, until everyone is
        fully satisfied. You will be served all your courses at once on a plate
        of food called a thali. A thali is a large tray that is used to serve
        all the foods at once. Some foods are mild, sweet and some are spicy and
        hot. The food ranges from very simple vegetarian to exotic dishes
        layered with texture and flavour. The common thread throughout the
        centuries remains the distinct mixing of spices that invariably give
        Indian cuisine its flavour and aroma.
