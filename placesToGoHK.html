          <h3>History and Identification</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Hong Kong means "fragrant harbor." Once administered by the United
            Kingdom, it has been known since 1997 as the Hong Kong Special
            Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
            Many residents do not identify with either Britain or China. The
            generation born and raised in Hong Kong from 1949 to 1979 (when
            China was isolated) has a much more local identity than do their
            parents.

          <h3>Neon Lights</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            A neon sign starts and ends with a line—or more specifically, a
            gas-filled tube of glass, heated and bent by a skilled craftsman,
            and set aglow by an electrical charge. Once illuminated, the line
            transforms: It mimics and abstracts, glows and flickers, and
            implores and distracts. Its symbols, signs and texts articulate a
            live-wired language of the modern city.

          <h3>Food in Daily Life</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            There is a wide variety of ethnic foods, including Italian,
            Japanese, French, and American. Most people, however, eat
            Cantonese-style Chinese food. Soups are especially important in most
            meals. A typical Cantonese food is dim sum, also known as yam
            chah, which is small snacks cooked in bamboo steamers. This meal is
            served seven days a week, and family members and friends often meet
            over tea on the weekend. Residents prefer to buy seafood live and
            meat freshly butchered. Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita
            consumption rates of fast food in the world, and students buy snacks
            such as potato chips, fried rice crackers, and prawn crackers from
            school snack shops.

          <h3>Street Food</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Hong Kong boasts a plethora of excellent restaurants, but if you
            want an authentic local experience, you must try the street food
            scene. Whether you're wandering around Causeway Bay, Mong Kok, Kwai
            Fong, Sham Shui Po, or any other lively neighbourhood, you're going
            to stumble upon an incredible selection of mouth-watering goodies
            being cooked up right there on the street. We're talking spicy
            fishballs, crispy eggettes, chewy cheung fun, and even some
            seriously stinky tofu. These tasty treats are not only delicious but
            also super budget-friendly, so you can fill up without emptying your
            wallet.

          <h3>Victoria Peak</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Standing at 552m, Victoria Peak is the highest point on Hong Kong
            Island. It is also one of the most visited spots by tourists, and
            it’s not hard to see why. Sweeping views of the metropolis, verdant
            woods and easy but spectacular walks are all reachable in just eight
            minutes from Central via Hong Kong’s 125-year-old,
            gravity-defying Peak Tram. Predictably, it's become a money-making
            circus with restaurants and two shopping malls, but there's still
            magic up here if you can get past that.

          <h3>Man Mo Temple</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            One of Hong Kong’s oldest temples and a declared monument,
            atmospheric Man Mo Temple is dedicated to the gods of literature
            (‘Man’), holding a writing brush, and of war (‘Mo’), wielding a
            sword. Built in 1847 during the Qing dynasty by wealthy Chinese
            merchants, it was, besides a place of worship, a court of
            arbitration for local disputes when trust was thin between the
            Chinese and the colonialists.
