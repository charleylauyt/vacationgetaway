          <h3>Food history</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Indian cuisine dates back over 5000 years. Each region has its own
            traditions, religions and culture that influence its food. Indian
            cuisine is meant to be eaten socially, in groups, until everyone is
            fully satisfied. You will be served all your courses at once on a
            plate of food called a thali. A thali is a large tray that is used
            to serve all the foods at once. Some foods are mild, sweet and some
            are spicy and hot. The food ranges from very simple vegetarian to
            exotic dishes layered with texture and flavour. The common thread
            throughout the centuries remains the distinct mixing of spices that
            invariably give Indian cuisine its flavour and aroma.

          <h3>Best for romantics and fans of Mughal history</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank
            of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned
            in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his
            wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

          <h3>Best for experiencing the power of devotion</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            India has pilgrimage destinations to spare, but few come close to
            the vibrant energy of the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The most sacred
            site for the Sikh religion is a gleaming jewel box, floating in a
            mirror-like sacred pool, thronged day and night by an unbelievable
            mass of pilgrims. You don’t have to be spiritually inclined to feel
            its powerful rhythms.
