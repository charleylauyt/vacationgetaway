          <h3>About</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Home of Maple Syrup - Canada is a country in North America. Its ten
            provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to
            the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the
            world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's
            longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's
            longest international land border. The country is characterized by a
            wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a
            sparsely inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority
            residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital
            is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto,
            Montreal, and Vancouver.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations,
            Inuit, and MÃ©tis, the last being of mixed descent who originated in
            the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European
            settlers and subsequently developed their own identity. The first
            inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have
            migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived
            at least 14,000 years ago. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at
            Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of
            human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Indigenous
            societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex
            societal hierarchies, and trading networks.Some of these cultures
            had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late
            15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through
            archeological investigations.

          <h3>Society</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of
            constituent nationalities and policies that promote a "just society"
            are constitutionally protected. Since the 1960s, Canada has
            emphasized equality and inclusiveness for all its people. The
            official state policy of multiculturalism is often cited as one of
            Canada's significant accomplishments and a key distinguishing
            element of Canadian identity. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong
            and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English
            Canadian culture. As a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic
            of regional ethnic subcultures.

          <h3>Art</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its
            Indigenous peoples, and, in later times, artists have combined
            British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at
            times embracing European styles while working to promote
            nationalism. The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse
            origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these
            influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.

          <h3>Ice Hockey</h3>
          <p class="mt10">
            The modern sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably
            in Montreal, where the first indoor game was played on March 3,
            1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the
            ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day.
